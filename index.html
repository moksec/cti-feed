The attack begins with a dropper app, TrustBastion, which uses scareware tactics and mimics Google Play update alerts. TrustBastion contacts a C2 server (trustbastion[.]com) that redirects to a Hugging Face dataset repository. The final payload, an unnamed Remote Access Tool (RAT), is downloaded from Hugging Face infrastructure via its CDN. Threat actors use server-side polymorphism to generate new payload variants every 15 minutes, with one repository accumulating over 6,000 commits in 29 days. The malware aggressively exploits Android's Accessibility Services to perform screen overlays, capture user screens, block uninstallation attempts, monitor user activity, and exfiltrate data. It displays fake login interfaces for services like Alipay and WeChat to steal credentials and attempts to steal lock screen codes. Bitdefender informed Hugging Face, leading to the removal of malicious datasets. IoCs for the dropper, network, and malicious packages were published.</div>

            <div class="view-content view-strategic">Microsoft's decision to disable NTLM by default in future Windows releases represents a critical strategic shift towards enhancing core operating system security. This move aims to mitigate long-standing vulnerabilities associated with NTLM, such as NTLM relay and pass-the-hash attacks, which have historically posed significant risks to Windows domains. Organizations globally must strategically plan for this transition, prioritizing the adoption of modern, Kerberos-based authentication to maintain a strong security posture and align with industry best practices for secure authentication, especially considering the phased approach and the 2026 timeline for key changes.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-operative">Security and IT operations teams should initiate audits using new tools available in Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025 to identify all instances where NTLM is currently in use across their environments. A detailed migration plan must be developed to transition away from NTLM to Kerberos-based authentication, or other secure alternatives, well before the default disablement in future Windows releases. Organizations should monitor for the introduction of new features like IAKerb and Local Key Distribution Center (scheduled for H2 2026) which will address NTLM fallback scenarios. While NTLM can be re-enabled via policy, this should only be considered as a temporary measure for critical legacy systems after thorough risk assessment, with a definitive plan for eventual deprecation.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">Microsoft will disable the NTLM authentication protocol by default in future Windows releases (client and server), due to security vulnerabilities. NTLM, introduced in 1993, is superseded by Kerberos, which is the default for Windows 2000 and later. NTLM's weak cryptography makes it vulnerable to NTLM relay attacks (e.g., PetitPotam, ShadowCoerce, DFSCoerce, RemotePotato0) and pass-the-hash attacks, allowing privilege escalation and domain compromise. Microsoft's plan involves three phases: (1) enhanced auditing in Windows 11 24H2 and Server 2025; (2) introduction of IAKerb and Local KDC in H2 2026 to address NTLM fallbacks; (3) default disablement of network NTLM in future OS releases. NTLM will remain in the OS, re-enableable via policy. This follows previous deprecation notices and advisories dating back to 2010. The OS will prefer Kerberos-based alternatives.</div>

            <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-warns-of-two-epmm-flaws-exploited-in-zero-day-attacks/" class="item-link" target="_blank">Ivanti warns of two EPMM flaws exploited in zero-day attacks <span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:13px;color:#666;white-space:nowrap;">- bleepingcomputer.com</span></a>
            <div class="view-content view-strategic">The disclosure of two critical, actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340) in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) presents a significant and immediate risk to organizations utilizing this platform. The ability for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code without authentication can lead to widespread data compromise, including sensitive organizational and user information, and potential access to internal network assets via integrated systems like Sentry. The active exploitation and high CVSS score of 9.8 necessitate urgent mitigation efforts to prevent severe operational disruption and data loss.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-operative">Organizations leveraging Ivanti EPMM must immediately apply the provided RPM hotfixes for versions 12.5.0.x, 12.6.0.x, 12.7.0.x, 12.5.1.0, and 12.6.1.0. These hotfixes do not require downtime but must be reapplied after any version upgrades until the permanent fix in EPMM 12.8.0.0 (expected Q1 2026) is released. Administrators should review Apache access logs (`/var/log/httpd/https-access_log`) for indicators of exploitation using the regular expression `^(?!127\.0\.0\.1:\d+ .*$).*?/mifs/c/(aft|app)store/fob/.*?404`. If compromise is suspected, the system should be restored from a known-good backup or rebuilt, followed by resetting all EPMM, LDAP/KDC, and other service account passwords, and revoking/replacing public certificates. Additionally, Sentry logs and connected internal systems should be reviewed for signs of lateral movement or reconnaissance.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">Two critical code-injection vulnerabilities, CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340, with CVSS scores of 9.8, affecting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) versions 12.5.0.x, 12.6.0.x, 12.7.0.x, 12.5.1.0, and 12.6.1.0, are being actively exploited as zero-days. These flaws allow unauthenticated remote code execution. Ivanti has released RPM hotfixes (12.x.0.x for 12.5.0.x, 12.6.0.x, 12.7.0.x; 12.x.1.x for 12.5.1.0, 12.6.1.0). The permanent fix will be in EPMM 12.8.0.0, slated for Q1 2026. Exploitation attempts, whether successful or not, manifest as 404 HTTP response codes in the Apache access log for requests targeting `/mifs/c/(aft|app)store/fob/` endpoints. CVE-2026-1281 has been added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.</div>
