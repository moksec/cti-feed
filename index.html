            <div class="view-content view-strategic">The ShinyHunters threat group, along with associated clusters (UNC6661, UNC6671), is conducting a highly sophisticated and effective campaign using vishing and advanced phishing to bypass Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This threat poses a significant risk to organizations relying on cloud-based SaaS applications, as successful compromise provides a springboard to extensive data exfiltration and subsequent extortion. The real-time nature of credential and MFA code relay during vishing calls makes traditional user training less effective and highlights the evolving challenge of social engineering attacks, threatening brand reputation, data integrity, and financial stability across various industries.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-operative">Organizations must prioritize hardening identity workflows and authentication resets, focusing on strong MFA configurations that are resistant to real-time relay attacks. Enhanced logging across identity providers (Okta, Microsoft Entra, Google SSO) and SaaS applications (Salesforce, M365, SharePoint, DocuSign) is critical to detect post-compromise activity. Specific behaviors to monitor include: rapid data exfiltration from SaaS platforms post-SSO compromise, PowerShell User-Agent access to file shares, unexpected OAuth authorizations (e.g., ToogleBox Recall), and deletion of MFA modification notifications. Implement advanced security solutions that can identify login anomalies, impossible travel, and unusual access patterns. Comprehensive employee training on identifying vishing attempts, even when they appear legitimate, is essential.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">Threat actors use targeted voice phishing (vishing) combined with company-branded phishing sites to steal SSO credentials and MFA codes in real time. They impersonate IT/helpdesk, direct victims to phishing sites that relay credentials, trigger legitimate MFA challenges (e.g., push notifications, OTPs), and instruct victims to respond. Attackers then enroll their own MFA devices to maintain persistence. Post-access, they leverage SSO dashboards (Okta, Microsoft Entra, Google SSO) to access connected SaaS applications like Salesforce, Microsoft 365, SharePoint, DocuSign, Slack, Atlassian, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include: PowerShell User-Agents for file downloads, specific IP addresses from commercial VPNs/residential proxies (Mullvad, Oxylabs, NetNut, 9Proxy, Infatica, nsocks), and phishing domains registered via NICENIC or Tucows using patterns like `<companyname>sso.com` or `<companyname>internal.com`. Attackers have also been observed using the 'ToogleBox Recall' Google Workspace add-on to delete 'Security method enrolled' emails to cover their tracks.</div>

            <div class="view-content view-strategic">A large-scale, financially motivated phishing campaign is targeting users globally by impersonating cloud storage providers. The actors leverage fear of data loss and payment failures to trick users into visiting scam websites, primarily to generate affiliate marketing revenue and potentially collect credit card information. This widespread tactic poses a significant risk to user data security and financial well-being, necessitating broad public awareness and robust organizational security measures.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-operative">Organizations should prioritize continuous security awareness training for all personnel, emphasizing the identification of phishing emails, especially those related to payment issues or data loss warnings from cloud services. Implement and maintain advanced email filtering solutions capable of detecting spoofed sender addresses, suspicious links, and urgent language. Educate users to independently verify cloud service notifications by directly visiting official provider websites or apps, rather than clicking links in emails. Ensure IT support is prepared to handle inquiries regarding suspicious cloud storage-related communications.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">The campaign uses phishing emails with various randomly generated domains and personalized subject lines designed to create urgency (e.g., 'Payment Declined', 'Account Blocked'). These emails falsely claim payment failures or storage issues will lead to data deletion. Initial links within the emails redirect through `storage.googleapis.com` (Google Cloud Storage) to scam sites impersonating legitimate cloud service portals, often displaying Google Cloud branding. These scam pages prompt users to 'upgrade storage' at a discount, ultimately leading to affiliate marketing pages for unrelated products (VPNs, security software) or checkout forms designed to collect credit card details. No specific CVEs were mentioned.</div>
