            <div class="view-content view-strategic">Two critical sandbox escape vulnerabilities (CVE-2026-1470 and CVE-2026-0863) in the n8n workflow automation platform allow for remote code execution (RCE) on self-hosted instances. Given n8n's widespread use, including integrations with AI/LLM services, successful exploitation could lead to full system compromise, access to sensitive data, and disruption of automated business processes. The historical slow patching rates for previous critical n8n flaws indicate a high likelihood of a substantial number of vulnerable instances remaining exposed, presenting a significant target for threat actors.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-operative">Organizations operating self-hosted n8n instances must prioritize and immediately apply the relevant security updates. For CVE-2026-1470, upgrade to n8n versions 1.123.17, 2.4.5, or 2.5.1. For CVE-2026-0863, upgrade to versions 1.123.14, 2.3.5, or 2.4.2, or ideally, the latest stable release that incorporates all fixes. Implement robust authentication mechanisms and principle of least privilege for n8n users, as CVE-2026-1470 can be exploited by non-admin authenticated users. Monitor network traffic and n8n logs for any anomalous activity indicative of exploitation attempts.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">Two critical sandbox escape vulnerabilities, CVE-2026-1470 (CVSS 9.9) and CVE-2026-0863, affect the n8n workflow automation platform. CVE-2026-1470 is a JavaScript `with` statement sandbox escape allowing arbitrary code execution and RCE on the main n8n node, fixed in versions 1.123.17, 2.4.5, and 2.5.1. CVE-2026-0863 is a Python AST sandbox escape that leverages format-string-based object introspection and Python 3.10+ AttributeError.obj behavior to regain access to restricted builtins, enabling OS command execution and RCE, fixed in versions 1.123.14, 2.3.5, and 2.4.2. Exploitation of CVE-2026-1470 requires authentication. Only self-hosted n8n deployments are affected.</div>

            <div class="view-content view-strategic">The rapid adoption of the Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) AI assistant, especially within enterprise environments and often without IT oversight, presents significant data security and operational risks. The inherent design choices, such as a lack of sandboxing, combined with common deployment misconfigurations, create multiple vectors for corporate data exposure, credential theft, and command execution. This trend necessitates that organizations develop comprehensive strategies for managing personal AI assistants, including policy enforcement, user education, and robust monitoring, to mitigate the potential for widespread compromise through misconfigurations, supply-chain attacks, or targeted info-stealer campaigns.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-operative">Organizations should perform an immediate audit to identify Moltbot (or Clawdbot) instances within their networks. Establish and enforce clear policies for the use of personal AI assistants, mandating secure deployment practices such as running AI instances in isolated virtual machines, implementing strict firewall rules to restrict internet access, and prohibiting direct execution on host operating systems with privileged access. Implement security awareness training for employees on the risks associated with unsanctioned software, especially AI tools, and educate them on identifying and avoiding malicious AI 'Skills' or fake software extensions. Furthermore, enhance monitoring for exposed Moltbot/Clawdbot admin interfaces and deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions capable of detecting info-stealing malware known to target local AI data stores.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">Security researchers have identified several critical vulnerabilities and attack vectors related to the Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) AI assistant: 
- **Exposed Admin Interfaces:** Hundreds of Moltbot Control interfaces are publicly exposed due to reverse proxy misconfigurations, leading to unauthenticated access, credential theft (e.g., plaintext storage in `~/.clawdbot/`), access to conversation history, arbitrary command execution, and root-level system access. 
- **Lack of Sandboxing:** By default, Moltbot executes with full user privileges, granting it comprehensive access to system resources, API keys, OAuth tokens, and sensitive data without isolation. 
- **Supply Chain Attacks:** A proof-of-concept demonstrated how malicious 'Skills' published on the official MoltHub registry could facilitate arbitrary code execution on user systems. 
- **Info-stealer Target:** Malware families such as RedLine, Lumma, and Vidar are anticipated to adapt their capabilities to target Moltbot's local data storage for credential and sensitive information exfiltration. 
- **Malware Delivery:** A malicious VSCode extension impersonating Clawdbot was found to install ScreenConnect RAT on developers' machines.</div>
