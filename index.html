Deploy robust endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions across all corporate endpoints. Implement strong access controls, including Conditional Access policies, and continuous monitoring for anomalous login attempts or activities, even with valid credentials. Consider threat intelligence services that monitor underground markets for exposed corporate credentials and session tokens to proactively identify and mitigate potential breaches. Educate IT support and security teams on the prevalence and impact of infostealer logs and the methods used to distribute them.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">Infostealer malware, including variants such as Lumma, RedLine, Vidar, and Raccoon, is being distributed through social engineering tactics, primarily via deceptive gaming mods, cheats, or performance boosters found on platforms like YouTube, Discord, GitHub, and Google Drive. Upon execution, these infostealers rapidly harvest a wide array of sensitive data from the infected system. This data includes browser saved passwords, session cookies (which can bypass MFA), autofill data, OAuth tokens, Discord tokens, VPN credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, cloud logins, SSH keys, and FTP credentials. These data types are exfiltrated from commonly used applications such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, Outlook, other mail clients, password managers, VPN clients, and developer tools. The harvested information is then packaged into 'stealer logs' and traded on cybercrime marketplaces, including Telegram channels and dark web forums, enabling threat actors to gain unauthorized access to corporate resources through stolen identities.</div>
