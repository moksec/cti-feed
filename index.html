            <div class="view-content view-strategic">Illicit cryptocurrency flows reached a record $158 billion in 2025, marking a significant 145% increase from the previous year. This surge, despite a slight decrease in the illicit share of total on-chain volume, highlights the growing challenge of financial crime within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Key drivers include increased sanctions-linked activity by nation-states (e.g., Russia, Iran, Venezuela), large-scale hacks, persistent scam operations, and continued ransomware activity. The professionalization of scams, potentially aided by AI, and the evolving methods of laundering (e.g., increased bridge usage) indicate a sophisticated threat landscape that requires global attention from financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and law enforcement.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-operative">Organizations operating with or in proximity to cryptocurrency should enhance their fraud detection and prevention mechanisms, particularly for investment scams and romance baiting schemes which account for a substantial portion of losses. Strengthened Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies and tools are critical to identify and block illicit flows, especially those linked to sanctioned entities and nation-state actors. Continuous monitoring of blockchain transactions for suspicious patterns, including the use of cross-chain bridges and other obfuscation techniques, is advisable. User education campaigns regarding common scam tactics and phishing attempts should be a priority to mitigate losses from social engineering. Security teams should also review and reinforce their defenses against sophisticated hacking attempts targeting crypto assets.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">The illicit cryptocurrency volume for 2025 reached $158 billion. Hacks accounted for $2.87 billion across 150 incidents, with the February 2025 Bybit breach (attributed to North Korean hackers) alone resulting in $1.46 billion in losses. Scam activity amounted to approximately $35 billion, predominantly investment scams (62%) showing increased organization and potential AI tool usage. Ransomware inflows remained elevated, though victim payments decreased, and the ecosystem saw 161 active strains and 93 new variants. Ransom laundering evolved, with mixer usage falling by 37% and bridge usage/cross-chain routing increasing by 66%.</div>

            <div class="view-content view-strategic">The ShinyHunters threat group, along with associated clusters (UNC6661, UNC6671), is conducting a highly sophisticated and effective campaign using vishing and advanced phishing to bypass Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This threat poses a significant risk to organizations relying on cloud-based SaaS applications, as successful compromise provides a springboard to extensive data exfiltration and subsequent extortion. The real-time nature of credential and MFA code relay during vishing calls makes traditional user training less effective and highlights the evolving challenge of social engineering attacks, threatening brand reputation, data integrity, and financial stability across various industries.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-operative">Organizations must prioritize hardening identity workflows and authentication resets, focusing on strong MFA configurations that are resistant to real-time relay attacks. Enhanced logging across identity providers (Okta, Microsoft Entra, Google SSO) and SaaS applications (Salesforce, M365, SharePoint, DocuSign) is critical to detect post-compromise activity. Specific behaviors to monitor include: rapid data exfiltration from SaaS platforms post-SSO compromise, PowerShell User-Agent access to file shares, unexpected OAuth authorizations (e.g., ToogleBox Recall), and deletion of MFA modification notifications. Implement advanced security solutions that can identify login anomalies, impossible travel, and unusual access patterns. Comprehensive employee training on identifying vishing attempts, even when they appear legitimate, is essential.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">Threat actors use targeted voice phishing (vishing) combined with company-branded phishing sites to steal SSO credentials and MFA codes in real time. They impersonate IT/helpdesk, direct victims to phishing sites that relay credentials, trigger legitimate MFA challenges (e.g., push notifications, OTPs), and instruct victims to respond. Attackers then enroll their own MFA devices to maintain persistence. Post-access, they leverage SSO dashboards (Okta, Microsoft Entra, Google SSO) to access connected SaaS applications like Salesforce, Microsoft 365, SharePoint, DocuSign, Slack, Atlassian, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include: PowerShell User-Agents for file downloads, specific IP addresses from commercial VPNs/residential proxies (Mullvad, Oxylabs, NetNut, 9Proxy, Infatica, nsocks), and phishing domains registered via NICENIC or Tucows using patterns like `<companyname>sso.com` or `<companyname>internal.com`. Attackers have also been observed using the 'ToogleBox Recall' Google Workspace add-on to delete 'Security method enrolled' emails to cover their tracks.</div>

            <div class="view-content view-strategic">Microsoft's decision to disable NTLM by default in future Windows releases represents a critical strategic shift towards enhancing core operating system security. This move aims to mitigate long-standing vulnerabilities associated with NTLM, such as NTLM relay and pass-the-hash attacks, which have historically posed significant risks to Windows domains. Organizations globally must strategically plan for this transition, prioritizing the adoption of modern, Kerberos-based authentication to maintain a strong security posture and align with industry best practices for secure authentication, especially considering the phased approach and the 2026 timeline for key changes.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-operative">Security and IT operations teams should initiate audits using new tools available in Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025 to identify all instances where NTLM is currently in use across their environments. A detailed migration plan must be developed to transition away from NTLM to Kerberos-based authentication, or other secure alternatives, well before the default disablement in future Windows releases. Organizations should monitor for the introduction of new features like IAKerb and Local Key Distribution Center (scheduled for H2 2026) which will address NTLM fallback scenarios. While NTLM can be re-enabled via policy, this should only be considered as a temporary measure for critical legacy systems after thorough risk assessment, with a definitive plan for eventual deprecation.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">Microsoft will disable the NTLM authentication protocol by default in future Windows releases (client and server), due to security vulnerabilities. NTLM, introduced in 1993, is superseded by Kerberos, which is the default for Windows 2000 and later. NTLM's weak cryptography makes it vulnerable to NTLM relay attacks (e.g., PetitPotam, ShadowCoerce, DFSCoerce, RemotePotato0) and pass-the-hash attacks, allowing privilege escalation and domain compromise. Microsoft's plan involves three phases: (1) enhanced auditing in Windows 11 24H2 and Server 2025; (2) introduction of IAKerb and Local KDC in H2 2026 to address NTLM fallbacks; (3) default disablement of network NTLM in future OS releases. NTLM will remain in the OS, re-enableable via policy. This follows previous deprecation notices and advisories dating back to 2010. The OS will prefer Kerberos-based alternatives.</div>

Furthermore, maintaining clear and transparent communication channels with security researchers during vulnerability disclosure is vital for fostering a collaborative security ecosystem. Users of such platforms are advised to regularly review and verify their privacy settings and be aware that even 'private' content may be subject to vulnerabilities. Consider the sensitivity of information shared on any platform, even with privacy controls enabled.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">Security researcher Jatin Banga discovered a vulnerability in Instagram where certain private profiles were leaking links to user photos. The flaw manifested when an unauthenticated user accessed a private profile from specific mobile devices; the HTML response body contained encoded CDN links to private photos within the `polaris_timeline_connection` JSON object. This was identified as a server-side authorization failure, not a CDN caching issue. Meta was informed but closed the case as 'not applicable' even though the exploit ceased to function shortly after the report was submitted. No CVE ID was provided. The researcher observed that approximately 28% of tested private profiles exhibited this vulnerability.</div>
