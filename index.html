Automated CI/CD checks for configuration errors should be deployed for network infrastructure. The adoption of BGP routing security mechanisms such as RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) and ASPA (Autonomous System Provider Authorization) is strongly recommended to prevent and mitigate the impact of route leaks and hijacks. Early detection mechanisms for routing anomalies are crucial for rapid incident response. Validate BGP policy against current RFCs like RFC 9234. Consider implementing stricter community-based export safeguards.</div>
            <div class="view-content view-technical">A 25-minute BGP route leak incident affected IPv6 traffic, caused by an accidental policy misconfiguration on a Cloudflare router in Miami. The misconfiguration led to an overly permissive export policy, causing Cloudflare to advertise internal IPv6 routes externally to BGP neighbors, resulting in Type 3 and Type 4 route leaks as defined by RFC7908. This caused measurable congestion, packet loss, and approximately 12 Gbps of dropped traffic across external networks. The issue was detected and manually reverted within 25 minutes. Cloudflare plans to implement stricter community-based export safeguards, CI/CD checks for policy errors, improved early detection, RFC 9234 validation, and RPKI ASPA adoption.</div>
