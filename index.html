                <p class="summary">The European Commission has initiated formal proceedings against X under the Digital Services Act (DSA) to investigate potential failures in risk assessment prior to deploying its Grok AI tool. This action stems from the tool's use to generate sexually explicit images, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM). As a designated Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) under EU law, X is required to mitigate systemic risks, a responsibility now under scrutiny. Concurrent investigations by UK authorities and the California Attorney General underscore a global concern regarding AI-generated illegal content and platform accountability. X's subsequent attempt to restrict Grok's image generation to paid subscribers has drawn criticism, highlighting broader challenges in regulating generative AI and content moderation.</p>
