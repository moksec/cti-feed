The attackers create fake job postings on platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Reddit for companies in the blockchain/crypto sector. The attack vector involves presenting applicants with coding challenges that require running projects containing malicious dependencies. These dependencies are published on legitimate package registries (npm and PyPi) and act as downloaders for a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). Researchers identified 192 malicious packages, some impersonating popular libraries (e.g., 'graphlib'). Malicious payloads were sometimes introduced in later versions of otherwise benign packages (e.g., 'bigmathutils' v1.1.0). The RAT can list processes, execute commands, exfiltrate files, and drop additional payloads, specifically checking for MetaMask cryptocurrency extension. C2 communication is token-protected. The campaign shows modularity, JavaScript, Python, and VBS variants, delayed activation tactics, and GMT +9 timestamps in Git commits, aligning with Lazarus Group TTPs.
